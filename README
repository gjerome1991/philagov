#Phila address lookup
Calls philly api concurrently to get address details

#To run

go build

The runtime file (philagov) expects a file "address.in.txt" that contains address and unit number separated by comma.
It calls the api concurrently for each line in address.in.txt.
The response for each API call for each address is logged in address.out.txt

As the json response comes back it is parsed into a struct which is printed to the command line.

If you want to build a OS specific runtime you can us GOOS env variable (https://golang.org/cmd/go/)

#Output

Output for test data in address.in.txt
